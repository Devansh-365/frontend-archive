# WELCOME TO FRONTEND ARCHIVE 💪

Hi, thanks for stopping by! Front-End Archive is a catalogue of projects, challenges & experiments. I decided to make a website that curates some of the best stuff I have built during my self-learning journey.
The tech stack I use is fairly consistent, so on this website, you would see projects built with the following technologies:

- ⚡️ Next.js
- ⚛️ React
- ⛑ TypeScript
- 🤔 JavaScript
- 👀 Sanity
- ✅ HTML & CSS
- 🤝 Chakra UI

Im always learning new stuff, so this is bound to change. ✨

### Tech Stack

**Client:** TypeScript, Next.Js, TailwindCSS

**Server:** Sanity

### Features

- Light/dark mode toggle
- Responsive Design
- Archive for frontend projects

### Development

To start the project locally, clone the repo & run:

```bash
yarn && yarn dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

### Scripts

- `yarn dev` — Starts the application in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`.
- `yarn build` — Creates an optimized production build of your application.
- `yarn start` — Starts the application in production mode.
- `yarn type-check` — Validate code using TypeScript compiler.
- `yarn lint` — Runs ESLint for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn format` — Runs Prettier for all files in the `src` directory.
- `yarn commit` — Run commitizen. Alternative to `git commit`.
